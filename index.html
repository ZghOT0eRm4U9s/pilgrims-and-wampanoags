        <p>The Pilgrims were English separatists, arrived on the Mayflower and established the Plymouth Colony in present-day Massachusetts. They had previously fled religious persecution in England and spent over a decade in the Netherlands before traveling to America seeking religious freedom to practice their Puritan faith.</p>

        <p>For more than 12,000 years, a group of Native Americans have lived here, the Wampanoags.</p>
        <p>The Wampanoags were known as the People of the First Light. They spoke an Algonquian language and lived in villages across the region. They held spiritual beliefs centered on nature.</p>

        <p><span class="newthought">History is when journeys converge and mysteries emerge.</span>We will analyze the historical choices made by the Pilgrims and Wampanoags and <strong>determine whether they should have worked together</strong>. Our research is based on a variety of narratives, but mostly on secondary sources. Because the Wampanoags left no historical records from their perspective, the true story is even more mysterious. We have done our best to piece together this incomplete puzzle.</p>

          <h3>The Mayflower Voyage</h3>
          <p>The Mayflower brought the Pilgrims from England to Plymouth Rock in 1620. The Mayflower was built to carry goods and supplies, not people. But on September 6, 1620, 102 passengers and 26 crew left Plymouth, England, for the New World. The Pilgrims were originally headed for Virginia, where colonists had been granted permission to settle. Stormy weather and navigational errors led the ship off course, and on November 21, the Mayflower rounded the tip of Cape Cod. The Pilgrims later settled near Plymouth Harbor. It took them 66 days to make the 2,750-mile journey, and they spent their first winter aboard the ship while they built their homes. Only 53 passengers and half the crew survived that first winter. When the weather improved, they founded the Plymouth Colony. On April 5, 1621, the Mayflower sailed back to England.</p>

          <h3>Facts About the Pilgrims</h3>
          <dl>
            <dt>What did the Pilgrims eat?</dt>
            <dd>The Pilgrims ate foods like dried fish, dried meat, cheese, and dried fruits during their voyage on the Mayflower. After landing in America, they ate foods from their first harvest, such as corn, pumpkins, and squash. They also ate venison provided by the Wampanoag tribe for their first Thanksgiving feast.</dd>
            <dt>What did the Pilgrims wear?</dt>
            <dd>The Pilgrims wore everyday clothing in the late 16th/early 17th century English style rather than the stereotypical all-black outfits. For men, this included items such as doublets, breeches, waistcoats, and petticoats made of wool or linen in a variety of colors. They did not usually wear buckled shoes or hats, as is often depicted.</dd>
            <dt>What did the Pilgrims believe in?</dt>
            <dd>The Pilgrims were English Puritan separatists who believed the Church of England was corrupt and sought religious freedom to worship as they pleased. They followed the teachings of John Robinson and other English separatist ministers.</dd>
            <dt>What were some of the major problems that had happened to the way the Pilgrims used to live?</dt>
            <dd>The Pilgrims faced many hardships during their first years in Plymouth Colony. They struggled with harsh weather conditions and lack of shelter during their first winter, which led to illness and many deaths. Diseases such as pneumonia killed nearly half of the Pilgrims that first winter. They also faced food shortages because their crops failed that first year. The native Wampanoag people helped the surviving Pilgrims learn new farming techniques so they could grow enough food to survive.</dd>
            <dt>For the pilgrims, what was the journey like?</dt>
            <dd>The Pilgrims' journey to North America aboard the Mayflower was a difficult one, taking 66 days to cross the Atlantic Ocean in late 1620. Conditions aboard the small ship were cramped and unsanitary, with limited food and frequent storms making the voyage rough. Many Pilgrims fell ill during the two-month voyage. After arriving in New England that November, the Pilgrims founded the Plymouth Colony.</dd>

        <h2>The Wampanoags</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>Facts About the Wampanoags</h3>
          <dl>
            <dt>What did the Wampanoags eat?</dt>
            <dd>The Wampanoag tribe's diet consisted primarily of crops they grew, making up approximately 70% of their food. These crops included the "three sisters" - corn, beans, and squash. They also hunted wild game, eating animals like deer, bear, rabbit, and turkey, which comprised less than 20% of their diet.</dd>
            <dt>What did the Wampanoags wear?</dt>
            <dd>The basic clothing for Wampanoag men and older boys was the breechcloth, which was made from soft deerskin. Wampanoag women typically wore long dresses with long sleeves. Both men and women wore moccasins and headwear which could signify tribe or status. Their clothing was made from available natural materials like animal hides, furs, and woven plant fibers.</dd>
            <dt>What did the Wampanoags believe in?</dt>
            <dd>The Wampanoags had a spiritual belief system centered around nature and the environment. They believed that spirits inhabited aspects of the natural world like the sea, sky, forests, and plains. Ancestors also played an important role in their beliefs. The Wampanoag tribe taught the importance of humility and thankfulness to the earth.</dd>
            <dt>What were some of the major problems that had happened to the way the Wampanoags used to live?</dt>
            <dd>Some of the major problems that affected the Wampanoags' traditional way of life were disease epidemics that killed many people, loss of land as European settlers arrived and took over territory, and attempts to force the Wampanoags to convert to Christianity and change their culture.</dd>

        <h2>Partnership Between the Pilgrims and the Wampanoags</h2>
        <h3>What Were the Differences Between the Wampanoags and the Pilgrims?</h3>
        <p>The Pilgrims and the Wampanoags come from different places. They have different beliefs, religions, and ways of life. The Pilgrims came to Massachusetts from England, while the Wampanoags have lived there for a long time. They use interpreters to communicate because they speak different languages. The Pilgrims consider themselves more modern and progressive, while the Wampanoags are considered more traditional.</p>
        <h3>Can a partnership benefit both groups?</h3>
        <p><span class="newthought">Yes.</span>The Pilgrims and the Wampanoag desperately needed each other. The Pilgrims arrived on the shores of Cape Cod way later than planned. They didn’t have enough food or shelter, and after the first long, bitter winter, half of the one hundred immigrants got sick and died.</p>
        <p>But the Wampanoags, who lived near where the Pilgrims landed, were also in desperate need. Some 90 percent had been killed by an epidemic brought by earlier European visitors. The Narragansett Indians, enemies of the Wampanoag, lived further inland and had escaped the epidemic.</p>
        <p>The Wampanoag needed allies, and the English, though few in number, had guns.</p>
        <p>The Wampanoag were generous, allowing the Pilgrims to build homes on Native land, providing them with corn, and teaching them how to plant and nourish it. The chief sachem of the Wampanoags was Ousamequin, also known by his title Massasoit. He became very sick and sent for Edward Winslow, who was the Pilgrim’s mediator. Conforming to Wampanoag tradition, Winslow sat with the sachem to give comfort and assistance, gently nourishing Ousamequin, who had been unable to take any food for days, with a little jam and then some broth. Day by day Ousamequin grew stronger. When he was satisfied that Ousamequin was no longer in danger, Winslow prepared to return home. Ousamequin said to him, “Now I see that the English are my friends and love me, and whilst I live, I will never forget this kindness they have shown me.” And so it was that as long as Ousamequin and Winslow lived, there was peace.</p>
        <h3>Is there any chance that a partnership between the Pilgrims and the Wampanoags might not work? Why?</h3>
        <p><span class="newthought">Yes.</span>The peace established remained firm even during the Pequot Wars of 1636-1638 CE and was only finally broken with the conflict known as King Philip's War (1675-1678 CE) by which time Bradford, Winslow, and Massasoit were dead.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, as the English population and power grew, they no longer felt obligated to conform to Native expectations. Ousamequin’s son Metacom, or Philip, tried to use law and diplomacy to push back against English encroachments on Native land and sovereignty. When those efforts failed, he prepared to go to war.</p>
        <p>During a last-ditch effort, on the eve of a war that would kill thousands of Native people and English immigrants, Metacom and other Wampanoag people met with English mediators and reminded them of their generous treatment of the Pilgrims.</p>
        <p>They said that when the English first came, Ousamequin was a great man and the English were like a little child. He constrained other Indians from wronging the English and gave them corn and showed them how to plant and was free to do them any good and gave them a hundred times more land than the king now had for his own people. When the English urged the Wampanoags to lay down their arms, for the English were too strong for them, they replied, “Then the English should do to them as they did when they were too strong for the English.” What if they had done to them as the Wampanoag did when they were too strong for the English? That question is worth considering today. The Wampanoag's words are a call to a higher law. We should treat other people as we would be treated, even when—especially when—power is unequal. The vision of that kind of a world, seen ever so briefly in Plymouth, is something beautiful.</p>
        <h3>For Pilgrims and Wampanoags, what potential hazards may occur as a result of partnership or ignoring each other?</h3>
        <h3>Should the Wampanoags and Pilgrims work together?</h3>
        <p><span class="newthought">Yes.</span></p>
