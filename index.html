        <p>In 1620, a group of Europeans, today called Pilgrims, landed and settled around Cape Cod.</p>

        <p>The Pilgrims were English separatists, arrived on the Mayflower and established the Plymouth Colony in present-day Massachusetts. They had previously fled religious persecution in England and spent over a decade in the Netherlands before traveling to America seeking religious freedom to practice their Puritan faith.</p>

        <p>For more than 12,000 years, a group of Native Americans have lived here, the Wampanoags.</p>
        <p>The Wampanoags were known as the People of the First Light. They spoke an Algonquian language and lived in villages across the region. They held spiritual beliefs centered on nature.</p>

        <p><span class="newthought">History is when journeys converge and mysteries emerge.</span>We will analyze the historical choices made by the Pilgrims and Wampanoags and <strong>determine whether they should have worked together</strong>. Our research is based on a variety of narratives, but mostly on secondary sources. Because the Wampanoags left no historical records from their perspective, the true story is even more mysterious. We have done our best to piece together this incomplete puzzle.</p>

          <h3>The Mayflower Voyage</h3>
          <p>The Mayflower brought the Pilgrims from England to Plymouth Rock in 1620. The Mayflower was built to carry goods and supplies, not people. But on September 6, 1620, 102 passengers and 26 crew left Plymouth, England, for the New World. The Pilgrims were originally headed for Virginia, where colonists had been granted permission to settle. Stormy weather and navigational errors led the ship off course, and on November 21, the Mayflower rounded the tip of Cape Cod. The Pilgrims later settled near Plymouth Harbor. It took them 66 days to make the 2,750-mile journey, and they spent their first winter aboard the ship while they built their homes. Only 53 passengers and half the crew survived that first winter. When the weather improved, they founded the Plymouth Colony. On April 5, 1621, the Mayflower sailed back to England.</p>

          <h3>Facts About the Pilgrims</h3>
          <dl>
            <dt>What did the Pilgrims eat?</dt>
            <dd>The Pilgrims ate foods like dried fish, dried meat, cheese, and dried fruits during their voyage on the Mayflower. After landing in America, they ate foods from their first harvest, such as corn, pumpkins, and squash. They also ate venison provided by the Wampanoag tribe for their first Thanksgiving feast.</dd>
            <dt>What did the Pilgrims wear?</dt>
            <dd>The Pilgrims wore everyday clothing in the late 16th/early 17th century English style rather than the stereotypical all-black outfits. For men, this included items such as doublets, breeches, waistcoats, and petticoats made of wool or linen in a variety of colors. They did not usually wear buckled shoes or hats, as is often depicted.</dd>
            <dt>What did the Pilgrims believe in?</dt>
            <dd>The Pilgrims were English Puritan separatists who believed the Church of England was corrupt and sought religious freedom to worship as they pleased. They followed the teachings of John Robinson and other English separatist ministers.</dd>
            <dt>What were some of the major problems that had happened to the way the Pilgrims used to live?</dt>
            <dd>The Pilgrims faced many hardships during their first years in Plymouth Colony. They struggled with harsh weather conditions and lack of shelter during their first winter, which led to illness and many deaths. Diseases such as pneumonia killed nearly half of the Pilgrims that first winter. They also faced food shortages because their crops failed that first year. The native Wampanoag people helped the surviving Pilgrims learn new farming techniques so they could grow enough food to survive.</dd>
            <dt>For the pilgrims, what was the journey like?</dt>
            <dd>The Pilgrims' journey to North America aboard the Mayflower was a difficult one, taking 66 days to cross the Atlantic Ocean in late 1620. Conditions aboard the small ship were cramped and unsanitary, with limited food and frequent storms making the voyage rough. Many Pilgrims fell ill during the two-month voyage. After arriving in New England that November, the Pilgrims founded the Plymouth Colony.</dd>

          <h3>Facts About the Wampanoags</h3>
          <dl>
            <dt>What did the Wampanoags eat?</dt>
            <dd>The Wampanoag tribe's diet consisted primarily of crops they grew, making up approximately 70% of their food. These crops included the "three sisters" - corn, beans, and squash. They also hunted wild game, eating animals like deer, bear, rabbit, and turkey, which comprised less than 20% of their diet.</dd>
            <dt>What did the Wampanoags wear?</dt>
            <dd>The basic clothing for Wampanoag men and older boys was the breechcloth, which was made from soft deerskin. Wampanoag women typically wore long dresses with long sleeves. Both men and women wore moccasins and headwear which could signify tribe or status. Their clothing was made from available natural materials like animal hides, furs, and woven plant fibers.</dd>
            <dt>What did the Wampanoags believe in?</dt>
            <dd>The Wampanoags had a spiritual belief system centered around nature and the environment. They believed that spirits inhabited aspects of the natural world like the sea, sky, forests, and plains. Ancestors also played an important role in their beliefs. The Wampanoag tribe taught the importance of humility and thankfulness to the earth.</dd>
            <dt>What were some of the major problems that had happened to the way the Wampanoags used to live?</dt>
            <dd>Some of the major problems that affected the Wampanoags' traditional way of life were disease epidemics that killed many people, loss of land as European settlers arrived and took over territory, and attempts to force the Wampanoags to convert to Christianity and change their culture.</dd>
